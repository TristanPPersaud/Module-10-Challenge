# Module 10 Challenge

## Description
This project creates a SQL database that allows a user to view their current departments, roles, and employees of their company. They may also add a department, role, employee, or update a current employees role. This provides a company with a way to easily access any relevant information that they require by querying through the tables set up in the schema of the database.
